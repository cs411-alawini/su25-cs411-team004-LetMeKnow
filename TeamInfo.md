## Project Summary

UrbanBird is a community-driven web platform that captures, aggregates, and visualises bird-sighting data in densely populated cities. By merging crowdsourced observations with authoritative ornithology datasets, the site reveals how avian species adapt to—and sometimes struggle in—urban habitats.

The application helps casual birders discover local “hot spots,” assists researchers tracking biodiversity trends, and gives city planners evidence for bird-friendly green-space design.
